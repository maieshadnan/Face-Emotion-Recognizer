# Face-Emotion-Recognizer
A face emotion recognizer built with TensorFlow and CNNs. This model achieved an accuracy of 80-90 on training data and 66 on validation data. I built it with 4 blocks of CNNs (Convolutional  Neural Networks) with Max Pooling. This can achieve pretty good results (Fun fact: I tested on my face and it was right!) and I am pretty happy with it. Try it on your own face :D<br />
